Description: 	This c++ application was developed to reconstruct 3-D data from two epipolar 
		constrained 2-D images using efficient block matching algorithm with left-right 
		consistency check. 
		The two epipolar constrained images are the left and right view of a stereo camera.
		Image handlers and datatypes used are from a custom implemented image processing
		library from Clemson University. (http://cecas.clemson.edu/~stb/blepo/download.html)

Usage: 		./[executable name] [filename 1] [filename 2]
		filename 1: path to the left image file
		filename 2: path to the right image file

Development IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
